## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the AI Ticket Classifier up and running quickly:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArtemRivnyi/ai-ticket-classifier.git
cd ai-ticket-classifier
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run with Docker Compose

Build and start the service using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To stop the service, execute:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API

Verify the deployment and functionality of the API:

#### Health Check

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/health
```

#### Classify a Ticket

Send a POST request to the classify endpoint with a sample ticket:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/classify \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"ticket":"I cannot connect to the VPN"}'
```
